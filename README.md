# Student-Fund-Transfer-Management
This application aims to resolve some of the issues faced in the currently existing Prerna DBT app where users face many problems regarding the interface and data management. Prerna DBT is used by govt secondary schools for managing money transfers to student accounts as a part of govt benefit schemes.

# Product perspective
Prior to the onset of the pandemic, the government used to provide various scholarships, mid-day meals and school dresses directly to the government school students. However, in the wake of the school shutdowns post COVID-19, the same couldn't continue to be carried out anymore. To provide an alternate means of distributing these benefits, the government switched to a direct money transfer scheme and this is where we believe our product can come in.
